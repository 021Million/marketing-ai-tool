## METADATA
- **Main Pillar:** Practical Play
- **Target Audience:** SMB owners and solo founders who've heard about AI tools but haven't figured out how to make them work for their actual business yet
- **Suggested Posting Times:** Tuesday 7:30am EST · Thursday 6:00pm EST

---

## ENGAGEABILITY SCORE
**Score:** 8/10
**Why:** AI agents doing real, economically meaningful work — not just chatting — is the shift most SMB owners haven't clocked yet. It's concrete enough to feel urgent, novel enough to stop the scroll, and slightly threatening enough to trigger a reply. The Figma AI monetization story reinforces that this isn't hype: companies are already making money from this.

## LONG POST (~1,000 characters)

AI isn't a chatbot anymore. It's an agent — and it's already doing work you're paying humans for.

Here's what dropped in the last 24 hours that should change how you think about your business:

→ OpenAI deployed AI agents to red-team smart contracts against each other — in "economically meaningful environments"
→ Figma reported AI monetization is *accelerating* its growth — not cannibalizing it
→ Tavus launched Phoenix-4: real-time emotional AI video with sub-600ms latency

The pattern? AI is moving from "help me write an email" to "handle the task, end to end."

For you, this week's play:

Pick ONE repetitive task that costs you 3+ hours a week — proposals, inbox triage, client onboarding FAQs.

Go to ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Build a simple agent or custom GPT around it. Give it your templates, your tone, your SOPs.

Test it for 5 days. Measure time saved.

You don't need to tokenize assets or launch a DeFi protocol.

You need to stop being the bottleneck in your own business.

## SHORT POST 1 – Funny / Meme-Adjacent

OpenAI now has AI agents fighting each other to find flaws in code.

Meanwhile I'm still copy-pasting my invoice template into a new Google Doc every month.

The gap is embarrassing. Don't be me from 6 months ago.

## SHORT POST 2 – Life Lesson / Mindset

Figma didn't panic when AI showed up in design.

They shipped AI features. Monetized them. Grew margins. Stock jumped 15%.

The businesses that will get wrecked by AI aren't the ones it replaces.

They're the ones that watch it replace them and do nothing.

Your move.

AI video just got scary good for small businesses.
