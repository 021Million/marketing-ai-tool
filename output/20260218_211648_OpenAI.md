## METADATA
- **Main Pillar:** Education
- **Target Audience:** SMB owners and solo founders who've heard "use ChatGPT" a hundred times but still haven't built a single workflow around it
- **Suggested Posting Times:** Tuesday 7:30am EST · Thursday 5:30pm EST

---

## ENGAGEABILITY SCORE
**Score:** 8/10
**Why:** OpenAI is perpetually top-of-mind but most posts stay surface-level — this package goes specific enough to cut through. The contrast between "everyone talks about it, nobody deploys it" creates instant tension that drives replies. Practical plays give lurkers a reason to save and act.

## LONG POST (~1,000 characters)

OpenAI isn't your problem. Your lack of a system is.

Most SMB owners have logged into ChatGPT at least once. Maybe typed a prompt. Maybe got a mediocre answer. Then closed the tab and went back to doing things manually.

That's not an AI problem. That's a workflow problem.

Here's what the operators actually doing it differently have figured out:

→ They don't use ChatGPT. They build *with* it.
→ One repeatable prompt + one real business task = one hour saved per week
→ Stack 5 of those? That's a part-time hire you didn't have to make.

Real example: A solo bookkeeper I know wrote ONE prompt template for client onboarding emails. Pulls in the client name, service tier, and next steps. What took 25 mins now takes 90 seconds.

That's not magic. That's just a system.

Your play this week: Pick your most repeated writing task. Draft one prompt. Test it 3 times. Refine it. Save it. Done.

You don't need to understand transformers. You need to stop winging it.

## SHORT POST 1 – Funny / Meme-Adjacent

ChatGPT users be like: "I asked it to write my bio and it was mid so AI is overhyped."

Bro you gave it 4 words and no context.

Garbage in. Garbage out. That's not OpenAI's fault. That's a you problem.

## SHORT POST 2 – Life Lesson / Mindset

The most expensive tool in your business is the one you paid for and never learned to use.

OpenAI's API costs pennies. Your avoidance costs hours.

Every week you "mean to figure it out" is a week a competitor who did is compounding their advantage.

Start ugly. Start small. Start this week.
