## METADATA
- **Main Pillar:** Practical Play
- **Target Audience:** SMB owners and solo founders who've downloaded every AI tool but still run their business the same way they did in 2022
- **Suggested Posting Times:** Tuesday 7am EST · Thursday 12pm EST

---

## ENGAGEABILITY SCORE
**Score:** 8/10
**Why:** AI content is saturated — but most of it talks *about* AI instead of showing exactly *what to do Monday morning*. This package cuts through by being embarrassingly specific. The contrarian angle (you're not behind because of tools — you're behind because of habits) creates defensiveness that drives replies. Emotional hit lands because it names the exact frustration: consumed everything, changed nothing.

## LONG POST (~1,000 characters)

You don't have an AI problem. You have a "pilot purgatory" problem.

You've tried ChatGPT. You bookmarked the Notion AI tutorial. You watched the Claude demo twice.

And your business still runs on gut instinct, overflowing inboxes, and you doing everything yourself.

Here's what's actually happening:

→ You're treating AI like a toy, not a team member
→ You're prompting randomly instead of building repeatable workflows
→ You're waiting to "figure it out" before committing to one use case

The fix isn't another tool. It's one boring, repeatable job.

Pick ONE task you do every single week. Client recap emails. Social captions. Proposal drafts. Meeting notes.

Now write a prompt that handles 80% of it. Save it. Use it every time.

That's your first AI employee. Unglamorous. Wildly useful.

One automated workflow compounds faster than a hundred half-tested experiments.

Start there. This week. Not next quarter.

## SHORT POST 1 – Funny / Meme-Adjacent

**Hook A:** My AI setup vs. my actual productivity
**Hook B:** POV: You have 47 AI tools and still write every email yourself
**Hook C:** You've spent more time researching AI than your accountant spends on your taxes ✅ RECOMMENDED

---

And somehow your follow-up emails are still late, your proposals still take 3 hours, and your "automation" is a sticky note on your monitor.

The tool isn't broken. The habit is.

Pick one task. Automate it today. Go.

## SHORT POST 2 – Life Lesson / Mindset

**Hook A:** The most dangerous place in AI adoption isn't ignorance — it's almost
**Hook B:** Knowing about a tool and using a tool are two completely different businesses
**Hook C:** Every hour you spend learning AI instead of deploying it is an hour your competitor just got back ✅ RECOMMENDED

---

Information without implementation is just expensive entertainment.

The SMB owners winning with AI right now aren't smarter than you. They're not more technical. They just stopped auditing and started shipping.

They picked something small. Built a clunky prompt. Used it anyway.

Perfection is a luxury. Momentum is the strategy.

What's one task you could hand to AI this week — even badly?

## SHORT POST 3 – Practical Play for SMB Owners

**Hook A:** The 20-minute AI workflow that saves consultants 5 hours a week
**Hook B:** Stop using ChatGPT like Google. Use it like this instead.
**Hook C:** Here's the only AI habit that actually sticks for busy SMB owners ✅ RECOMMENDED

---

Every Friday, do this:

1. Open ChatGPT or Claude
2. Paste your messiest, most-repeated weekly task (client update? invoice follow-up? content brief?)
3. Type: "Write a reusable prompt template I can use every week to handle this"
4. Save it in a Notion doc called "AI Crew"

Week 1: awkward. Week 4: you've got 4 AI "hires" handling your busywork.

Tool: ChatGPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet (both free tiers work)
Time investment: 20 min/week
Timeline to feel the ROI: 3–4 weeks

That's it. No course needed.
