## ENGAGEABILITY SCORE
**Score:** 8/10
**Why:** The Nvidia x Meta compute deal and Figma's AI monetization surge are genuinely spicy news anchors that will resonate with founders who are watching AI eat software. The contrast between billion dollar infrastructure plays and "what do I actually do Monday morning" is a tension this audience lives in daily. Strong emotional pull for anyone who has wondered if they are too late to the AI wave.

## LONG POST (~1,000 characters)

Nvidia just flipped the script on how AI power gets built.

Wired reported it this morning. Nvidia's deal with Meta signals the end of the era where tech giants just buy discrete chips. Now they need full computing stacks: GPUs, CPUs, networking, the whole thing. At the same time, Figma dropped earnings showing AI monetization is accelerating their growth, with gross margins held while more users pile into Figma Make.

Here is what those two data points together are telling me.

The big players are locking in infrastructure at a scale that most founders will never touch. Saudi's Humain just dropped $3 billion into xAI's Series E. These are not product bets. These are picks and shovels bets on the AI era lasting decades.

And while that is happening, Figma is printing revenue because it embedded AI directly into a workflow people already paid for.

That is the lesson. Not the billion dollar raises. Not the GPU wars. The lesson is Figma's playbook.

Find the workflow your customer already lives in. Embed AI there. Charge for the outcome, not the feature.

I see SMB owners trying to bolt AI onto the side of their business like a new logo. That is not the move. The move is to find the one thing your team does manually every single week that is eating 4 to 6 hours, and replace it with an automation that runs while you sleep.

This week, pick one. Just one. Map the steps. Find the tool that closes the gap. Run the experiment.

You do not need a $3 billion war chest. You need one workflow and the discipline to actually ship it.

## SHORT POST 1 – Funny or Meme Adjacent

Saudi Arabia: here is $3 billion for xAI.
Me: here is a Make.com zap and a prayer.

Both of us are betting on AI. Only one of us has a meeting with Elon. The other one is automating email follow-ups at midnight and calling it a pivot. Figma just proved the real money is in the boring workflow. So yeah. Back to the zap.

## SHORT POST 2 – Practical Play for SMB Owners

Figma just proved AI monetization works when it is inside the workflow, not beside it.

Here is the SMB version of that play. Do this this week:

Step 1: List every task your team does manually more than twice a week. Just write them down. Do not overthink it.

Step 2: Circle the one that is the most repetitive and the most time consuming. Usually it is something like client onboarding, invoice chasing, content repurposing, or intake forms.

Step 3: Go to Make.com or Zapier. Search for a template that covers that task. Most of them already exist.

Step 4: Run the automation in parallel with your manual process for 5 days. Track time saved.

Step 5: If it saves 3 or more hours a week, you have just found your first ROI-positive automation. Now you can build on top of it.

Figma did not reinvent design. They made the thing their users already did faster and smarter. That is the entire playbook. You do not need to be a developer to run it.

**CTA:** Save this and run step 1 before Friday. No excuses.

## SHORT POST 3 – Life Lesson and Mindset (Miss AI)

I watched Zuckerberg testify yesterday and felt something I did not expect.

He sat in that courtroom using careful language and playing it safe while the whole world watched. Wired called it "repetitive answers and buzzwords." Billions of dollars of platform power, and he defaulted to the playbook.

And I thought about how many times I have done the same thing. Not in a courtroom. But in a pitch. In a client meeting. In a moment where I knew the real answer but gave the safe one because I was afraid of the reaction.

Here is what I have learned the hard way as a woman in tech and venture: playing it safe rarely saves you. It just delays the moment when you have to be honest anyway, except now you have also lost credibility.

The best thing Miss AI has done this year is say the uncomfortable thing first. About what AI can and cannot do. About what an automation actually saves versus what it does not. About where I have failed and rebuilt.

Your audience, your clients, your investors: they can smell the safe answer. It does not build trust. It just fills silence.

Be the person in the room who says the real thing. Especially when it is harder.
